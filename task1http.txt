1.Diffrence between http1 and http2;
HTTP 1 Protocol
• HTTP methods are Get, Put or Post.
• Request target such as URL or port is used.
• It uses text based commands for HTTP requests.
• It had official recognition in 1996.
• The new response headers allowed multiple file types e.g. plain text, HTML, images etc.
• It uses text based commands for HTTP requests.
• It added many performance enhancements e.g. caching, request pipelining, keepalive connections, transfer encoding, byte range requests etc.
• It can load one requests at a time. Hence one request per one TCP connection is possible.
HTTP 2 Protocol
• It was released in Feb. 2015 by IETF.
• It is binary and not textual.
• It is fully multiplexed.
• It interleaves multiple requests/responses in parallel without blocking on anyone.
• It uses single TCP connection to deliver multiple requests/responses (in parallel).


2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

*object easier to access all data.
*An object is a key value pair structure.
*objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
*These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data types (Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol)
Object creation
syntax::
  var objectname={key:value);
example:

 var student=(name:"poovizhi",dept:"IT",stuid:31};
Accessiblity of object
   Method:01(dot method)
    syntax::
      objectname.keyname;
    example:
       console.log(student.name);
   Method:02(box method)
       *the key must be in double quotes
       syntax::
         objectname["keyname"];
       example:
           console.log(student["name"]);
Add new key value in object
    syntax::
      objectname.keyname=value;
    example:
        student.gender="female";
Update object
   syntax::
 objectname.keyname=value;
    example:
        student.id=05;
Delete object
  syntax::
     delete objectname.keyname;
   example:
       delete student.gender;
